[ErlVoIP](ErlVoIP.md) is a collection of Voice Over IP modules that are going to be tired together to create a VoIP server written in [Erlang](http://erlang.org).

The current design for [ErlVoIP](ErlVoIP.md) will include connecting to a SIP provider and using RTP. A voicemail system and a way for SIP clients to connect to the [VoIP](VoIP.md) server are also on the [design goals](DesignGoals.md).

In the long run, this project is meant to create a fully functional PBX style telephone switch that will be fully distributed and easily expanded without needing to recompile  or restart [ErlVoIP](ErlVoIP.md).

ErlVoIP is part of the [Erlang Internet Framework](http://erlsoft.org/about/).
